## About

A private, self-hosted personal finance app that pulls new transactions automatically and doesn't require trusting anyone else with your financial data or credentials.

## Instructions

1. Copy the file `.env.sample` to `.env` in the main directory and update the values accordingly.

2. Create an empty folder named `data` in the main directory.

3. Run the following:

```sh

## Principles
